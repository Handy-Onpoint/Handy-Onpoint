                <p>
                We are fresh on the scene and eager to gain customer appreciation. 
                We started small and now built up through
                word of mouth and customer referrals. It’s simply a 
                tribute to the treatment our clients received with every 
                visit, and every repair. 
                
                </p>

                Handy Onpoint was established in 2021. Through diligence we’ve 
                grown our customer base and look to gain more business. This 
                thing started with the owner, who worked under his father, 
                and grandfather as a kid. Those experiences inspired him to 
                complete trades programs, and take it even another notch to 
                build a Chicagoland area Handyman Service. His passion for 
                leaving every customer with a smile has led to a warm hometown 
                reputation. Our clients love us.
